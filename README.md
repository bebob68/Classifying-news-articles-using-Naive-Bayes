I aim to predict the category of the news articles that are imported from google news.
We use naive bayes to find the probability of a category by finding the weight and category of keywords in the article

## What is Naive Bayes ?
Naive Bayes methods are a set of supervised learning algorithms based on applying Bayes’ theorem with the “naive” assumption of conditional independence between every pair of features given the value of the class variable.
MultinomialNB implements the naive Bayes algorithm for multinomially distributed data, and is one of the two classic naive Bayes variants used in text classification (where the data are typically represented as word vector counts, although tf-idf vectors are also known to work well in practice).
